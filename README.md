Project Details – BioForge

BioForge is a web-based knowledge engine designed to organize, visualize, and make actionable NASA’s 608 research papers in space biology. It features a dynamic dashboard with statistics cards, interactive charts (bar, pie/doughnut, line), and a top-domains panel to provide quick insights into research trends. A knowledge graph visually maps domains and crosscutting areas, with individual paper nodes displaying titles, summaries, and links. Users can filter by domain, search by title or domain, and take notes via a local storage notes app.

The AI research assistant enhances exploration by searching through NASA’s OSDR (Open Space Data Repository) and SLSL (Space Life Sciences Library), tailoring outputs to the user’s technical depth and research goals. Developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js for visualizations, BioForge uses responsive design, smooth transitions, and real-time updates to maximize interactivity.

Benefits include rapid access to curated research, enhanced comprehension of domain relationships, and streamlined decision-making for researchers. Its creativity lies in combining a knowledge graph, AI assistant, and interactive dashboard to tackle information overload. Key considerations included usability, scalability, and accuracy in data classification, ensuring the platform is both informative and intuitive.
